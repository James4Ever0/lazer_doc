So we can get them out pretty easily.\nmark them up and put a rank over them. i wanna see the shit.\nhey! give you this thing, you may consider it as some thing good. THE INCLUSION ALGORITHM.\nSimply, if something is inside the interval of another thing's interval, then the other thing is considered superior than the former. also, if it appears to be less frequent  than the former (by this i mean the period, or just some local period i think).\nalso you need to teach the computer to consider brackets as another thing which needs to be concluded, appears as a group and cannot be simply parsed as something normal."
