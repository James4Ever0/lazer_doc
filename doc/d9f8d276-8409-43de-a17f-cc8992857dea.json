THE DIR FUNCTION!\nWe need vim script or GUI controller to do vim automation. Autoexpect won't do.\ndef func(x):\n# add this line\n\tprint(type(x))\nMaybe we shall understand the tokenization more deeply.\nUse tokenize. Use xml parser.\nTHE TYPE DETECTER OF SOURCE FILE CANNOT BE AS NAIVE AS EXECUTING IT USING EXPECT AND SEE IF THERE IS SYNTAX ERROR. better use highlighter or some tokenizer. deeplearning is the best."
