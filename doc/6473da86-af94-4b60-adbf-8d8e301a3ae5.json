I ain't got nothing with the fucking shit.\nalright then. i just want to make sure that my standard spliters get out.\n--------TO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION--------\nyou need to know that you are not genius. thses functions are for experts, and all you have got is shit.\nno need to do the comprehension. we do the most basic machine learning from here.\nyou, must start with some basic operations:\n1. shift\n2. tweak\n3. switch\nAlso, you need not only to fine grain the ibgredents, but also to separate, categorize them. You must group something together when in need.\ntwo grouping methods:\n1. inclusion\n2. exclusion or encapsule.\n--------- REMEMBER THE RULE HERE ---------\nnever ignore the content. if you do, then you will never get the idea of the punctuation.\nconsider the time-space distance. when the space is large, or the relevancy is low, then you shall put each of them into different group."
