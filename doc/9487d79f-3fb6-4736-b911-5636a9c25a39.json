    "summary": "This Haskell code imports the System.Environment module and defines two functions, t and t0. The function t checks if a list consists only of digits. Function t0 takes a list, transforms it into a tuple by applying t to each element, and returns the transformed list. In the main function, it gets command-line arguments, applies t0 to them, and prints both the original list and the transformed list.",
