    "summary": "The code connects to a SQLite database, creates a table named 'chainer' with columns for startId, endId, and dayName. It ensures the uniqueness of each entry by setting a constraint on these columns in ascending order. The code then commits the changes and closes the connection. The comment suggests that intermediate things should be processed before entering data into the graph database, with alphabetical order, case relationships being one-directional. Labels can have relationships too, but it is unclear if certain labels are not usable or if they should be distinguished. The code does not specify how to handle this situation.",
