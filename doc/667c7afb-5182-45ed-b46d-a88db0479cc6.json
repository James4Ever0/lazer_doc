It is implemented in Python and can be used for text processing tasks where maintaining word order is crucial. The function `same_fuck()` finds unique words and their frequencies in a string using difflib and re modules.",

It then removes elements from a list based on certain conditions, potentially leaving only the words that appear in the same order between the strings. Finally, it returns a new list containing these words. The code is currently implemented in Python and could be used for various text processing tasks where preserving word order is important.",
