The purpose of this table seems related to handling alphabetical order and case relationships in an undetermined context. It suggests that labels can have relationships too but doesn't elaborate on it. The code raises questions about label distinction, inserting random stuff first or maintaining the relationship, without providing clear directions or solutions.",
