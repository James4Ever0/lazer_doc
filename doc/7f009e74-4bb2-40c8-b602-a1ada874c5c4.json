The code suggests storing relevant information in a hierarchical manner using a graph database like Neo4j for better file management and making connections between different elements.",

But what we want to do here is to make connections. So we shall use our graphdb sometimes."

Train the module with most common characters, and then simply perform the work. You can also do this using other OCR tools. Fetch multiple fonts over different languages and if possible, the handwriting.\nwe need a list of all scannable files.\nwe need a list of all scannable names.\nusually do not judge the thing by its name, because it will be very fucking wrong.\nconclude the directory by the files under it, and we usually need a exhaustive list.\nremember the conclusion is important because we need to find something in common here.\nfind the similar patterns.\nalso, multithreading can be applied using lua, system native support or just pure python.\nI think grammarly could be used as text corrector here. BUT I NEED MY OWN TYPO CORRECTOR."
