    "summary": "This code defines a function named \"scheme\" that takes two parameters, \"a\" and \"b\". The variable \"a\" is a tuple containing the name of a lambda function and its arguments. The code then prints the types of variables produced by executing the arguments of \"a\", and finally returns a new lambda function created by combining \"b\" with the second element of \"a\". In this example, it calls the \"scheme\" function with a tuple containing the name \"superLamb\" (a lambda function) and its argument \"(1,2)\" to execute and print the types of variables produced.",
