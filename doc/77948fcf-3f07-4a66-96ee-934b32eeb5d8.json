It creates a temporary file called \"shallowCopy.sh\" in write mode. Then it iterates through each term in the plist and writes a command to copy each file to the specified destination using the \"cp\" command. The \"&\\n\" at the end of each line ensures that commands are written on separate lines in the temporary file.",
