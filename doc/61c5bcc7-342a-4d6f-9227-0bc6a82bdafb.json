The code checks for characters that are not lowercase or uppercase alphabets and stores these non-alphabetical characters into another list called 'hotspot'. Finally, it prints out both lists. The purpose of this exercise seems to be filtering out common patterns from the text using ASCII values, possibly as part of a larger program involving other functions like 'sexy' and 'wrap'.",
