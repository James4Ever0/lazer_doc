It is like holding a nintendo switch doing vim jobs. Feeling like shit but this is fucking awesome! Man this is the thing I want for a fucking long time! You simply can't imagine how fucking good it feels like to code using this fucking keyboard!\nWhat's more, this shit is fully featured. It includes every shitty key onto one single shit would you fucking believe that? Fuck me please? It even has the fucking backlight fuck me just do it now! Nothing is as good as this little piece of shit, nothing!\nBut it will still be problematic if I wanna put a lambda when coding haskell (fuck me even the fucking HHKB does not have a separate key for the fucking lambda!), and thus how do we make it happen? Just consult the haskell community online. It will do the trick."
