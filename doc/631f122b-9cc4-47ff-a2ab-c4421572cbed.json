The `fuckall` function takes a list as input, filters it by checking if consecutive elements are one more than the previous element, and removes any elements that don't fit this pattern. It also loops twice to remove any trailing elements that don't meet the condition. Finally, it returns the filtered list. The `same_fuck` function takes a superstring as input, splits it using spaces as delimiters, calls the `fuckall` function on the resulting list of positions, and returns the resulting filtered list. The code also includes comments that mention not being concerned about time complexity, but this is not necessarily accurate.",
