But actually, no matter what license is put under my fucking project, no one will even give a shit about my project for the fuck sake!\nIt is when I realize how good to have WTFPL here. You might see some 3rd party code fetched from here and there inside this project, but I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THEIR LICENSE, AND I DO NOT RESPECT THEIR COPYRIGHT. My work here is utterly clear: to try my best to make it work. Any other things are out of my consideration.\n## I don't give a shit about the consequence\nThere might be some reports saying robot riots or disadvantages of agent AIs, BUT I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT IT."

It expresses a desire to create an AI capable of solving general problems, but also emphasizes that the creator doesn't care about potential misuse.

Piles of shits are placed everywhere, and misinformation transfers into everyone's ears.\nI AM TRYING MY BEST TO MAKE A REAL AGENT AI, A REAL GENERAL PROBLEM SOLVER TO FREE EVERY INDIVIDUAL ON EARTH FROM WORK. You may use it to do anything, including massacre if you wish to BUT I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THAT.\n## Thinking is evil, learning is evil, working is evil\nI HATE REPETITIVE TASK. In the past, I only refer few actions as repetitive but now I have realized that EVERYTHING ON EARTH IS REPETITIVE. I then doubt why this is true and the answer is obvious. IT IS THE NATURE OF NATURE.\nMaybe someone will consider time traveling after this project is done but I have to say: NO MORE TRICKS ON US, NATURE."
